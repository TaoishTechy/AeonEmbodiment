# AeonEmbodiment
Open-source ARM framework (32/64-bit, 512MB+1-core min) fusing PleromaForge with dynamic GPIO learning, sensor/relay auto-adaptation, WiFi/BT/LoRa as evolving I/O, efficient video/audio processing (e.g., via optimized OpenCV/GStreamer). Self-adjusts to hardware limits for salvific robotics.
